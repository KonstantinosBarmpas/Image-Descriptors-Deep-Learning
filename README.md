# Image Descriptors Deep Learning Project

## Summary

This report outlines a proposed neural network model for generation of image descriptors for image representation in the Euclidean Space. With these descriptors, matching, veriÔ¨Åcation and retrieval tasks should be performed successfully.

## The project

In the introduced project we were given a baseline approach for the creation of image descriptors and we were asked to improve it. Our approach should be outlined in a 3-page (paper-like style) report and be accompanied with a notebook with our Keras code.

## This repo

This repo includes both the paper-report and the notebook.
